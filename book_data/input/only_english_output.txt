./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(1)/13.jpg	Curator of the Department for the Publication of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(1)/14.jpg	Sanskrit Manuscripts, Trivandrum.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/1.jpg	P R E F A C E.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/2.jpg	This edition of the work is based on three palm leaf
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/4.jpg	were obtained from the Palace Library, Trivandrum and the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/5.jpg	third from the library of the Raja of Kilimanur. The
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/7.jpg	since been available for use, and hence no description of it is
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/10.jpg	some fragments of the Gaņitapäda and the whole of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/11.jpg	Golapäda. These two manuscripts which alone were avail-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/12.jpg	able for collation are legibly written and appear to be about
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/13.jpg	two centuries old. There is a noticeable gap in both the manus-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/15.jpg	on page 118 in the Bhāşya of the 17th Sūtra of the Ganita-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/18.jpg	connection with the context. As this piece however, was
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/19.jpg	found to fit in another gap found in the Bhāşya of the 18th
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/20.jpg	Sūtra in the Ganitapāda, it was accordingly placed there.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/23.jpg	Sūtra in the Ganitapāda. All my attempts to fill up this
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/24.jpg	gap have hitherto been in vain. I secured a loan of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/25.jpg	manuscript of Nīlakantha Bhāşya from the Central Manus-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/26.jpg	cript Library, Baroda, but to my surprise and disappoint-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/27.jpg	ment, the same gap was found in that copy also as in our
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/29.jpg	know how two manuscripts coming from such two distant
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/30.jpg	countries contained one and the same gap, but I postpone my
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/31.jpg	enquiry in the matter to a future occasion, when I shall have
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/32.jpg	secured other manuscripts of the work for the Department.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/33.jpg	A complete manuscript of the work has not yet been procur-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/34.jpg	ed; however, in view of the rare merit of the Bhāşya, I have
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/35.jpg	placed the first part before the learned public.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/36.jpg	I take this opportunity of expressing my sincere appre-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/37.jpg	ciation of the commendable patience and enthusiasm shown
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/38.jpg	by the Pandits of the department in preparing this difficult
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/39.jpg	and erudite work for the Press, notwithstanding the fact
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/40.jpg	that the manuscript materials at their disposal were far from
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(7)/41.jpg	satisfactory.

./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/2.jpg	With the publication of the first part containing the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/3.jpg	Ganitapada of Aryabhatiya, the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/4.jpg	is numerically entering on the second centesimal cycle. The
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/5.jpg	Jyotissastra is composed of three branches, viz., Ganita,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/6.jpg	Samhita and Hora, and the Aryabhatiya deals with the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/7.jpg	Ganita branch. The work consists of four parts or Padas,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/8.jpg	namely Gitikapada, Ganitapada, Kalakriyapada and Golapada.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/9.jpg	There is another division of the work, the first consisting of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/10.jpg	Gitikapada of 13 Arya verses and the second, comprised of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/11.jpg	the three other Padas containing 108 Arya verses; and thus the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/12.jpg	work contains on the whole 121 Arya verses.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/13.jpg	The work had been a mine of knowledge for Lalla,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/14.jpg	Munjala and Bhaskaracharya who respectively wrote Sisyadhi-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/15.jpg	vrddhida, Manasakarana and Siddhantasiromani after obser-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/16.jpg	vations of the planetary movements. After studying the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/17.jpg	BrahmaSiddhanta and the other work of his predecessors and ob-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/18.jpg	serving the planetary movements of his time, Aryabhata
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/19.jpg	wrote his work for the benefit of the succeeding generations
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/20.jpg	of students.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/22.jpg	troductory verse of the Ganitapada, the commentator Bhas-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/26.jpg	Aryabhata followed the Svayambhuva Siddantha as it had
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/27.jpg	been highly respected by the learned people of Kusumapura.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/30.jpg	called Asmaka. It is said that this country was a part of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/31.jpg	Southern India , while some take it to be the same as the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/32.jpg	ancient Travancore; see for example Apte's Sanskrit Dic-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/33.jpg	tionary. The work of Aryabhata has long been popular in
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/34.jpg	Kerala more than in any other country and the commenta-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/35.jpg	tors of the work are akk if them known as Keraliyas. It
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/36.jpg	is therefore possible that Aryabhata was a native of Kerala
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/37.jpg	and migrated to Kusumapura, the imperial capital of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/38.jpg	Guptas, for patronage; and it is a matter for congratulation
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/39.jpg	f he was a native of Travancore, a part of the Kerala country.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/1.jpg	From the Arya verse,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/4.jpg	(Kālakriyā pāda Ślo. 10)
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/6.jpg	we learn that Aryabhata flourished in the latter half of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/7.jpg	5th century A. D., and that this work which was written by
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/8.jpg	him when he was only 23 years old, was received by the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/9.jpg	public very favourably though he was so young.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/10.jpg	Since the time of Bhāskarācārya, Northern India is not
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/11.jpg	known to have produced as many original writers on Jyotis-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/12.jpg	sāstra as the Kerala country in Southern
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/13.jpg	India. Verily, the stars that shone on the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/14.jpg	sky of Kerala might have felt highly pro-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/15.jpg	pitiated inasmuch as the intellect of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/16.jpg	Keraliyas found in astronomy a fitting field
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/17.jpg	to work upon and produced Brhadbhāska-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/18.jpg	rīya Drgganita, Tantrasangraha, Siddhāntadarpana and
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/19.jpg	many other valuable works. It is a pity that these precious
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/20.jpg	works are still slumbering in the archives of this country,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/21.jpg	though their publications are highly to be wished for.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/22.jpg	Among the valuable works on Astronomy, one is the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/23.jpg	Bhāşya on Aryabhatiya by Nīlakantha. It is worthy of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/24.jpg	note that no one who is not a Keralīya has
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/25.jpg	Aryabhatīya Bha- hitherto ventured to write either a Bhāşya
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/26.jpg	or a Vyākhyā on the Aryabhatīya The
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/27.jpg	Vyākhyā named Bhatadīpikä on the work,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/28.jpg	printed and published in Holland was written by no other
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/29.jpg	than Parameśvarācārya of Kerala, who, for the first time,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/30.jpg	propounded the Drgganitatantra after 55 years of study.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/31.jpg	This fact is evident from the following verses found in the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/32.jpg	introduction of his commentaries on the Aryabhatiya and
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/33.jpg	Lilāvati,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/40.jpg	which state clearly that Paramesvaracarya lived on the bank
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/41.jpg	of the River Nila near the sea shore in North Kerala.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/1.jpg	3
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/2.jpg	The Bhasya of Nilakantha is called Mahābhāşya as is
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/3.jpg	seen from the words of the author himself,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/10.jpg	As it closely follows the methods adopted by Patanjali in
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/11.jpg	his Vyakaranamahābhāşya, I think this Bhāşya fully
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/14.jpg	in the above quotation also go to justify the title. It is a
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/15.jpg	matter for satisfaction that we have been enabled to publish
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/16.jpg	a work on astronomy which goes a long way to remove the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/17.jpg	charge levelled against Jyotişa that there is no expository
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/18.jpg	Bhāsya in it as in other Sāstras. From the following obser-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/19.jpg	vations in the Bhāşya,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/28.jpg	it appears that the author is adding to his text the portion
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/29.jpg	of another Bhāşya that was caused to be written by Fausī-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/30.jpg	taki Nārāyana, but this additional portion of the text runs
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/31.jpg	only on the Sūtras from 15th to 17th but not on those from
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/32.jpg	18th to 26th, though the author tells us at the close of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/33.jpg	20th Sūtra that he has transcribed the Bhāşya of Kausi-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/34.jpg	taki up to that extent. The author had not commented on
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/35.jpg	the Gitikāpāda evidently with the idea that the meaning of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/36.jpg	it would be clear to anyone who studied his Bhāşya on the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(11)/37.jpg	three other Padas as he himself explicitly says,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/1.jpg	4
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/2.jpg	This Bhāşya which from its rare merits surpasses those
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/3.jpg	of Bhaskarācărya, Suryadeva, Ghatīgopa and others will, I
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/4.jpg	think, be found useful not only by the students of Jyotiś
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/5.jpg	sāstra, but also by others interested in Sanskrit literature.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/6.jpg	The closing colophon of the Bhasya.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/9.jpg	reveals that Nilakantha was a disciple of Damodara, son of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/10.jpg	Paramesvarācārya, that he was a native of Kunda Grāma *
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/11.jpg	and belonged to Garga Gotra and Asyala-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/12.jpg	yana Sakhā and that both his father and
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/13.jpg	maternal uncles were named Jātaveda and
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/14.jpg	his brother Sankara.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/15.jpg	As the commentary on Tantrasangraha explains the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/16.jpg	first line in the introductory verse,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/19.jpg	and the third line of the concluding verse,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/22.jpg	as also representing two chronograms of the Kali days on
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/23.jpg	which respectively the work was begun and finished, the date
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/24.jpg	of Nilakantha may be fixed between 1450 A. D. 1550 A. D.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/25.jpg	From the line
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/27.jpg	in the Dřgganita of Parameśvarăcārya, we learn that it was
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/28.jpg	written in Saka 1353 corresponding to 1430 A. D. It is
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/29.jpg	quite possible therefore that Nilakantha, a disciple of Param-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/30.jpg	esyarācārya wrote his Tantrasangraha some 70 years after
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/31.jpg	the latter wrote his Drgganita. Nīlakantha has also written
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/32.jpg	Golasāra, Tantrasangraha, Siddhāntadarpaņa and many
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/33.jpg	other original works; and, among these Golasära and
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/34.jpg	Tantrasangraha must have been written earlier than the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(12)/35.jpg	present Bhäşya which refers to them by name thus,

./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/8.jpg	the venerable persons whom he pays homage to in the in-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/9.jpg	troductory verse of the work,

./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/19.jpg	Mention may be made here of the sidelight thrown by the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/20.jpg	works of Nilakantha on certain obscure points in regard to
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/21.jpg	Thunchattu Ezhuttacchan, justly regarded as the father of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/22.jpg	Mr. Justice P. K. Narayana Pillai B.A., B.L., of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/24.jpg	Board, he brought to my notice, the reference to "Sri
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/25.jpg	Nilakantha Guru", in the Harināma Kirtanam, one of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/26.jpg	Ezhuttacchan's works. This leads to the information that
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/27.jpg	our Nīlakantha was the Guru or teacher of Ezhuttacchan.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/28.jpg	This is strengthened by the allusion to Netra-Nārāyana in
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/29.jpg	Malayalam Brahmāndapurāņam which is another work by
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/30.jpg	Ezhuttacchan or by a disciple of his, as some would have
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/31.jpg	lation of the Azhuväncheri Thamprakkal. The Kausitaki
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/32.jpg	referred to by Nīlakantha in the passages quoted above is
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/33.jpg	none other than the Azhuvāncheri Thamprakkal, one of the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/34.jpg	foremost, if not the foremost dignitary in the West Coast
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/35.jpg	Hierarchy. This is evident from the following reference,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/38.jpg	made by Nilakantha himself. In the light of this informa-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/39.jpg	tion, the necessary landmarks to fix Ezhuttacchan's date, a
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(13)/40.jpg	point involving some controversy among Malayalam scholars
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/1.jpg	6
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/2.jpg	become easily available, since Nīlakantha's date is easily
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/3.jpg	gatherable from the chronograms quoted from the Tantra
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/4.jpg	sangraha. This aspect of the subject has been discussed by
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/5.jpg	Mr. Justice Narayana Pillai, in his lectures on Ezhuttacchan
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/6.jpg	delivered recently at the instance of the University of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/7.jpg	Madras. As he observed during the course of those lectures,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/8.jpg	Nīlakantha reveals himself as a solid mass of erudition, sub-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/9.jpg	merged some how or other under the current of time.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/10.jpg	Dämodara, Guru of Nīlakantha and son of Parameśv-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/11.jpg	aräcärya has written a work named Muhûrtābharana as is
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/12.jpg	clear from the following introductory verse of the work,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/19.jpg	Nilakantha was well-versed not only in Jyotiśśāstra,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/20.jpg	but also in other branches of knowledge such as Mīmāmsā,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/21.jpg	Nyāya, Vyakarana and Vedānta and in support of this state-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/22.jpg	ment may be cited the following passages, among others
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/23.jpg	from his Bhāşya,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/27.jpg	In the Ganitapāda Bhāşya, the author cites as authority
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/28.jpg	Vrddhagarga, Varāhamihira, Pingala and other ancient
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/29.jpg	teachers; Bhaskara, Govindasvāmi, Süryadva, Madhava
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/30.jpg	and other later authors; Vaijayanti Gargasamhitā, Sürya-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/31.jpg	siddhānta and other works; thus suggesting that his Bhāşya
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/32.jpg	was written on the line of ancient authoritative commen-
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/33.jpg	taries.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/34.jpg	His ripe scholarship on Jyotiśśāstra seasoned as it is
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/35.jpg	with his close acquaintance with the works of various ancient
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/36.jpg	teachers by adding to the importance of the Aryabhatiya,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/37.jpg	has brought lasting credit to the Kerala people. We are
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/38.jpg	gratified that our desire to enrich the series by publishing
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(14)/39.jpg	more Jyotişa works as expressed in the introduction of the

./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/11.jpg	Aryabhatiya is a concise work designated to give very
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/12.jpg	briefly and in pithy language the principles of Indian astro-
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/13.jpg	nomy and mathematics. It contains only 121 verser in the
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/14.jpg	Arya metre, divided into 4 padas, Gitikapada (13 verses),
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/15.jpg	Ganitapada (33), Kalakriyapada (25) and Golapada (50).
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/16.jpg	Written in teerse language and in the conventional
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/17.jpg	manner, the work requires elucidation for proper under-
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/18.jpg	standing. But we do not find many commentaries of this
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/19.jpg	very valuable work. The excellent Bhasya of Nilakantha
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/20.jpg	Somasutvan published from this Library and carried to
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/21.jpg	completion in this volume, is therefore, bound to be of great
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/22.jpg	interest and immense value to the students of this science.

./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/24.jpg	was Gargya Kerala Nilakantha Somastuvan was a highly
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/25.jpg	accomplished astronomer of Kerala who lived in the
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/26.jpg	16th century A.D. He was popularly known as Kelal u
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/27.jpg	Comatiri. (See Kerala Sahitya Caritram- Mahakavi
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(2)/28.jpg	Ullur- Vol. II. pp. 170). He is known to be the author of
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(3)/1.jpg	2
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(3)/2.jpg	five works- Aryabhatiya, Bhasya, Tantrasamgraha,
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(3)/3.jpg	Siddhantadarpana, Golasya and Candracchayaganita. He
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(3)/4.jpg	has given some facts about himself in Aryabhatiya Bhasya
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(3)/17.jpg	From this it is clear that he was a resident of
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(3)/18.jpg	Trkkantiyur in South Malabar. It can also be gathered
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(3)/19.jpg	from other statements of his own,
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(4)/3.jpg	that the commentary of Aryabhatya was originally
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(4)/4.jpg	undertaken at the behest of his patron *Netranarayana and
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(4)/5.jpg	that it was completed after the death of his patron and
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(4)/6.jpg	during the author's old age. The claim made by the
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(4)/7.jpg	author on behalf of this great Basya cannot be considered
./ABBV3/Lines/ABBV3-page-(4)/8.jpg	to be exaggerated in any way.

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/2.jpg	We learn from the above that Yallaya was the son of Śrīdharārya
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/3.jpg	and was a pupil of Suryācārya1 son of Bălāditya. This Śrīdhara (14th-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/4.jpg	15th cent.) is, obviously, different from his namesake Sridhara (c. A.D.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/5.jpg	900) who wrote the Patiganita and the Trisatika. Similarly, Suryācārya
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/6.jpg	(14th-15th cent.) is different from Suryadeva Yajvan (b. 1191), and is
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/7.jpg	the author of Ganakananda, Daivajñābharaṇa and Daivajñabhūșaņa.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/8.jpg	A closing verse of his commentary Kalpalata on the Suryasiddhānta
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/9.jpg	supplies the additional information that he belonged to the Kāśyapagotra
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/10.jpg	and that his grandfather's name was also Yallaya.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/11.jpg	Yallaya was a native of Skandasomeśvara, which lay to the south-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/12.jpg	east of the renowned temple-town of Śrīśaila in the Telugu Country.2
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/13.jpg	He indicates in his supplementary commentary on A., iii. 6 that he
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/14.jpg	composed the work at Skandasomeśvara,3 of which place he gives the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/15.jpg	measure of the equinoctial midday shadow as 3 (1/3) angulas and the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/16.jpg	equinoctial midday hypotenuse as 12 (7/75) angulas. These measurements
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/17.jpg	specify a place having a latitude of 15° 30' N. Skandasomesvara is also
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/18.jpg	stated to be 36 yojanas from the Hindu prime meridian (according to
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/19.jpg	the reckoning of the Suryasiddhānta which corresponds to 4° 5' to the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/20.jpg	east of the said meridian.

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/15.jpg	Library, Madras, being Mss. Nos. 13390, 13392 and 13393, the last
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/16.jpg	with the supplement of Yallaya to Süryadeva's commentary, were
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/17.jpg	examined for possible use in the present critical edition. It was however
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/18.jpg	found that each of these manuscripts was replete with all types of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/19.jpg	scribal and intrinsic errors, including omissions, gaps, wrong trans-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/20.jpg	criptions, textual corruptions etc., and, so, was utterly unreliable.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/21.jpg	These manuscripts could not, therefore, be used in the present edition.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/22.jpg	2. Reliability of the Manuscripts
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/23.jpg	In consonance with ms. A having, originally, been prepared for
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/24.jpg	the scholarly royal family of Edappaļļi, it has been transcribed by an
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/25.jpg	apparently reliable scribe and the text preserved herein is generally
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/26.jpg	correct. Scribal errors and confused writing, exclusive to A, are rare,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/27.jpg	though not absent. However, there are a good number of haplographical
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/28.jpg	omissions, some of which are exclusive to A, and the others which it
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/29.jpg	shares with mss. B and C. In view of the otherwise reliability of the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/30.jpg	manuscript, these, exclusive omissions have to be attributed to the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/31.jpg	original manuscript from which A has been copied.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/32.jpg	Ms. B too presents a generally reliable text. While scribal
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/33.jpg	errors are comparatively few, it contains a large number of minor and
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/34.jpg	major omissions of different types, haplographical, indicated and
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/35.jpg	unindicated, most of which, if not all, have to be traced to its original.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/36.jpg	These omissions, indeed, detract, to some extent, from the value of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/37.jpg	the manuscript.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/1.jpg	INTRODUCTION                        xlix
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/2.jpg	Earlier, in the same context, Yallaya takes the Kali year 4581
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/3.jpg	(=A.D. 1480), to demonstrate the calculations involved in computing
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/4.jpg	the planets.1 This would mean that he wrote the work about this date.2
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/5.jpg	2. His works
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/6.jpg	Yallaya is the author of at least five more works on mathe-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/7.jpg	matics and astronomy. They are : (1) Ganita-sangraha,3 a treatise
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/8.jpg	on arithmetic, (2) Jyotișadarpaņa,4 on astronomy, (3) Kalpavallī,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/9.jpg	a commentary on Suryasiddhānta5 and (4) Kalpalata,6 an extensive
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/10.jpg	commentary on the Laghumanasa of Muñjāla whom Yallaya uniformly
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/11.jpg	calls by his alternative name Manjula. (5) A commentary in Telugu of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/12.jpg	the Suryasiddhanta by Yallaya has also been recorded.7
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/13.jpg	3. Nature of the Supplementation
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/14.jpg	Yallaya's supplementation leaves out the Gitikā-pāda and covers
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/15.jpg	only the Ganita, Kalakriya and Gola sections of the Aryabhatīya and

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/2.jpg	takes the form of additional notes and worked out examples relating to
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/3.jpg	mathematical computation occurring in the said three sections. Some of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/4.jpg	these examples are his own and the others culled from earlier astronomers
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/5.jpg	like Bhaskara I. His own illustrations are prefixed with expressions like
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/6.jpg	madīyodāharaṇāni. The Ganita-rāda, the Sphuta section of he Kāla-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/7.jpg	krijā-pada and the Grahaņa Section of the Gola-pāda are particularly
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/8.jpg	rich in these extra examples. Often, additional elucidations are given
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/9.jpg	to the textual verses and new topics are introduced and explained. A
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/10.jpg	number of compendious verses (sangraha-ślokas) composed by Yallaya
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/11.jpg	himself are also found strewn all over the Supplement. The views,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/12.jpg	explanations and examples of Yallaya's teacher Sūryācārya also come in
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/13.jpg	for citation. To cite an instance : After recording Suryadeva's comment
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/14.jpg	on Ā, Gaạita 11, Yallaya introduces his teacher's views with the prefatory
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/17.jpg	4. Supplementation on Conjunction of planets
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/18.jpg	A lengthy supplement covering several pages added to Gola. 45
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/19.jpg	is highly instructive. In this supplement Yallaya works out in detail
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/20.jpg	illustrative examples for the conjunction of Jupiter and Moon which
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/21.jpg	occurred in Kali 4557 (A.D. 1456), of Saturn and Moon which occurred
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/22.jpg	in Kali 4566 (A.D. 1465), a solar eclipse which occurred in Kali
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/23.jpg	4567 (A.D. 1466) and a lunar eclipse which occurred in Kali 4580
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/24.jpg	(1479). This excursus is interspersed with a large number of Yallaya's
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/25.jpg	own summary verses and observations on the merits of different
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/26.jpg	astronomical authorities. Some of the said observations are particularly
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/27.jpg	interesting. Thus, on the comparative ease in the computation of

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/36.jpg	At one place, the supplementation of Yallaya takes the form of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/37.jpg	an auxiliary work. Thu, after recording Suryadeva's commentary on
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(88)/7.jpg	125
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/1.jpg	INTRODUCTION                          xxi
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/2.jpg	Ms. C, which has the distinction of having been prepared by a
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/3.jpg	scholarly prince Rama (Varman), again, presents a generally reliable
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/4.jpg	text, in spite of there being a few exclusive variants, errors, omissions
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/5.jpg	of the haplographical and unindicated types, and repetitions. But from
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/6.jpg	the careful manner in which the manuscript has been written, these
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/7.jpg	defects have, mostly, to be traced to the original from which it has
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/8.jpg	been copied. It might be noted that C shares several peculiarities in
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/9.jpg	readings with A and B.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/10.jpg	Ms. D, a fine specimen of a manuscript, which also belonged to
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/11.jpg	the royal family of Edappaļli, contains a fairly accurate text. A long
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/12.jpg	omission occurs in the beginning and several minor ones towards the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/13.jpg	middle, all being scrupulously indicated by blank spaces. Exclusive
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/14.jpg	errors, haplographical omissions and unindicated omissions are few,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/15.jpg	but not absent. The ms. contains also a number of unique variant
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/16.jpg	readings, minor additions, transpositions, elaborations and, what is
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/17.jpg	more important, supply of the omissions in A-B-C, some of which it
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/18.jpg	shares with E.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/19.jpg	Ms. E, found in a codex of astronomical works, preserves a
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/20.jpg	generally correct text akin to that in D, but also often differing
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/21.jpg	therefrom. It exhibits a large number of peculiarities of its own,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/22.jpg	including unique variants, blanks, haplographical omissions, unindicated
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/23.jpg	omissions, errors and transpositions. Notwithstanding these limi-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/24.jpg	tations, the manuscript is, on the whole, reliable. Other differences

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/28.jpg	3. Mutual relationship of the Manuscripts
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/29.jpg	The individual traits, including exclusive variant readings,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/30.jpg	haplographical omissions, transpositions, gaps and errors, which
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/31.jpg	characterise each of the manuscripts described above indicate the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/32.jpg	impossibility of any one of them having been directly copied from any
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/33.jpg	other, thus ruling out any immediate relationship and establishing their
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/34.jpg	independent nature. However, some of the manuscripts bear certain
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/35.jpg	common features which would enable their being classified into
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/36.jpg	versions.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/37.jpg	Version 1. The three manuscripts A, B and C exhibit some
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/38.jpg	telling similarities. Apart from certain special readings and common
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/39.jpg	omissions, these three manuscripts preserve identical errors1 and
