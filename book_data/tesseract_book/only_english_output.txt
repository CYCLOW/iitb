./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/6.jpg  Samhita and Hora, and the Aryabnatiya deals with the
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/7.jpg  Ganita branch. The work consists of four parts or Padas,
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/8.jpg  namely, Gitikapada, Ganitapada, Kalakriyapada and Golapada.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/9.jpg  There is another division of the work, the first consisting of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/10.jpg  Gitikapada of 13 Arya verses and the second, comprised of
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/11.jpg  the three other Padas containing 108 Ary& verses; and thus
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/12.jpg  the work contains on the whole 121 Arya verses.
./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(9)/13.jpg  The work had been a mine of knowledge for, Lalla,

./ABBV1/Lines/ABBV1-page-(10)/6.jpg  we learn that Aryabhata flourished in the latter half of the

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/1.jpg  xiviii  ARYABHATIYA
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/2.jpg  We learn from the above that Yallaya was the son of Sridhararya
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/3.jpg  and was a pupil of Suryacarya! son of Baladitya. This Sridhara (14th-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/4.jpg  15th cent.) is, obviously, different from his namesake Sridhara (ce. A.D
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/5.jpg  900) who wrote the Patiganita and the Trisatik@. Similarly, Suryacarya
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/6.jpg  (14th-15th cent.) is different from Stryadeva Yajvan (6. 1191), and is
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/7.jpg  the author of Ganakananda, Daivajriabharana and Daivajitabhisana,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/8.jpg  A closing verse of his commentary Kalpalata on the Suryasidananta
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/9.jpg  supplies the additional information that he belonged to the Kasyapagotra
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/10.jpg  and that his grandfather’s name was also Yallaya.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/11.jpg  Yallaya was a native of Skandasomeégvara, which lay to the south-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/12.jpg  east of the renowned temple-town of Srisaila in the Telugu Country.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/13.jpg  He indicates in his supplementary commentary on A, i. 6 that ne
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/14.jpg  composed the work at Skandasome$vara,’ of which place he gives the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/15.jpg  measure of the equinoctial midday shadow as 34 anguias and. the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/16.jpg  equinoctial midday hypotenuse as 12x'¢ angulas. These measurements
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/17.jpg  specify a place having a latitude of 15° 30° N. Skandasomesvara is also
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/18.jpg  stated to be 36 yojanas from the Hindu prime meridian (according to
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/19.jpg  the reckoning of the Suryasiddhanta’ which corresponds to 4° 5 to the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(48)/20.jpg  east of the said meridian.

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/15.jpg  Library, Madras, being Mss. Nos. 13390, 13392 and 13393, the last
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/16.jpg  with the supplement of Yallaya to Stryadeva’s commentary, were
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/17.jpg  examined for possible use in the present critical edition. It was however
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/18.jpg  found that each of these manuscripts was replete with all types or
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/19.jpg  scribal and intrinsic errors, including omissions, gaps, wrong trans-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/20.jpg  criptions, textual corruptions etc., and, so, was utterly unreliable.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/21.jpg  These manuscripts could not, therefore, be used in the present edition.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/22.jpg  2. Reliability of the Manuscripts
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/23.jpg  In consonance with ms. A having, originally, been prepared for
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/24.jpg  the scholarly royal family of Edappalli, it has been transcribed by an
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/25.jpg  apparently reliable scribe and the text preserved herein is generally
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/26.jpg  correct. Scribal errors and confused writing, exclusive to A, are rare,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/27.jpg  though not absent. However, there are a good number of haplographical
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/28.jpg  omissions, some of which are exclusive to A, and the others which it
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/29.jpg  shares with mss. Band C. Im view of the otherwise reliability of the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/30.jpg  manuscript, these, exclusive omissions have to be attributed to the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/31.jpg  original manuscript from which A has been copied.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/32.jpg  Ms. Btoo presents a generally reliable text. While scribal
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/33.jpg  errors are comparatively few, it contains a large number of minor and
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/34.jpg  major omissions of different types, haplographical, indicated and
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/35.jpg  unindicated, most of which, if not all, have to be traced to its original.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/36.jpg  These omissions, indeed, detract, to some extent, from the value of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(20)/37.jpg  the manuscript,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/1.jpg  slix
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/2.jpg  Earlier, in the same context, Yallaya takes the Kali year 4581
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/3.jpg  (=A.D. 1480), to demonstrate the calculations involved in computing
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/4.jpg  the planets! This would mean that he wrote the work about this date.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/5.jpg  ?. His works
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/6.jpg  mallayats is the author of at least tive more works on mathe-  si fee ee ee Bee a ae
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/7.jpg  matics and astronomy. They are: (1) Ganfta-sangraha,? a_ treatise
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/8.jpg  on arithmetic, (2) Jyotisadarpana,* on astronomy, (3) Kalpaval'i.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/9.jpg  a commentary on Srryasiddhdnta’ and (4) Kalpalata® an extensive
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/10.jpg  commentary on the Laghumanasa of Munjala whom Yallaya uniformly
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/11.jpg  calls by his alternative name Marijula, (5) A commentary in Telugu of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/12.jpg  the Saryasiddhanta by Yallaya has also been recorded.‘
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/13.jpg  3. Nature of the Supplementation
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/14.jpg  Yallaya’s supplementation leaves out the Gitika-pada and covers
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(49)/15.jpg  only th: Ganita, K@lakriy@ and Gola sections of the Aryabhatiya and

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/2.jpg  takes the form of additional notes and worked out examples relating to
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/3.jpg  mathematical computation occurring in the said three sections. Some of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/4.jpg  these examples are his own and the others cu!led from earlier astrono ners
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/5.jpg  like Bhaskara I. His own illustrations are prefixed with exprcssions like
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/6.jpg  madiyodaharanani. The Ganita-ra@da, the Sphuta section of the Kdia-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/7.jpg     pdda and the Grakana Section of the Gola-padda are particularly
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/8.jpg  rich in these extra examples. Often, additional elucidations are given
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/9.jpg  to the textual verses and new topics are introduced and explained. A
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/10.jpg  number of compendious verses (sangraha-Slokas) composed by Yallaya
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/11.jpg  himself are also found strewn all over the Supplement. The views,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/12.jpg  explanations and examples of Yallaya’s teacher Suryacarya also come in
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/13.jpg  for citation. To cite an instance : After recording Stryadevas comment
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/14.jpg  on A, Ganita 11, Yallaya introduces his teacher's views with the prefatory
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/17.jpg  4. Supplementation on Conjunction of planets
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/18.jpg  A lengthy supplement covering several pages added to Gola. 45
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/19.jpg  is highly instructive. In this supplement Yallaya works out in detail
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/20.jpg  illustrative examples for the conjunction of Jupiter and Moon which
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/21.jpg  occurred in Kali 4557 (A.D. 1456), of Saturn and Moon which occurred
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/22.jpg  in Kali 4566 (A.D. 1465), a solar eclipse which occurred in Kali
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/23.jpg  4567 (A.D. 1466) and a lunar eclipse which occurred in Kali 4580
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/24.jpg  (1479). This excursus is interspersed with a large number of Yallaya s
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/25.jpg  own summary verses and observations on the merits of different
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/26.jpg  astronomical authorities, Some of the said observations are particularly
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/27.jpg  interesting. dihus, on the comparative ease in the computation of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/35.jpg  S. An auxiliary work
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/36.jpg  At one place, the supplementation of Yallaya takes the form of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(50)/37.jpg  an auxiliary work. Thus, after recording Stiryadevas commentary on
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(88)/7.jpg 
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/1.jpg  INTRODUCTION «  xxi
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/2.jpg  Ms. C, which has the distinction of having been prepared by a
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/3.jpg  scholarly prince Rama (Varman), again, presents a generally reliable
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/4.jpg  text, in spite of there being a few exclusive variants, errors, omissions
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/5.jpg  of the haplographical and unindicated types, and repetitions. But from
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/6.jpg  the careful manner in which the manuscript has been written, these
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/7.jpg  defects have, mostly, to be traced to the original from which it has
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/8.jpg  been copied. It might be noted that C shares several peculiarities in
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/9.jpg  readings with A and B.
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/10.jpg  Ms. D, a fine specimen of a manuscript, which also belonged to
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/11.jpg  the royal family of Edappalli, contains a fairly accurate text. A long
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/12.jpg  omission occurs in the beginning and several minor ones towards the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/13.jpg  middle, all being scrupulously indicated by blank spaces. Exclusive
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/14.jpg  errors, haplographical omissions and unindicated omissions are few,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/15.jpg  but not absent. The ms. contains also a number of unique variant
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/16.jpg  readings, minor additions, transpositions, elaborations and, what is
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/17.jpg  more important, supply of the omissions in A.B-C, some of which it
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/18.jpg 
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/19.jpg  Ms. E, found in a codex of astronomical works, preserves a

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/22.jpg  including unique variants, blanks, haplographical omissions, unindicated
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/23.jpg  omissions, errors and transpositions. Notwithstanding these lim-
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/24.jpg  tations, the manuscript is, on the whole, reliable. Other differences
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/25.jpg  in E include unique additions, supply of omissions in other mss., and
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/26.jpg  a large number of minor elaborations to expressions in A.B.C, some of
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/27.jpg  which are common to D and EF.

./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/29.jpg  The individual traits, including exclusive variant readings,
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/30.jpg  haplographical omissions, transpositions, gaps and errors, which
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/31.jpg  characterise each of the manuscripts described above indicate the
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/32.jpg  impossibility of any one of them having been directly copied from any
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/33.jpg  other, thus ruling out any immediate relationship and establishing their
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/34.jpg  independent nature. However, some of the manuscripts bear certain
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/35.jpg  common features which would enable their being classified into
./ASY/Lines/ASY-page-(21)/36.jpg  versions.
